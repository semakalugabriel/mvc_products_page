PHP Skills Test
This is a simple web application that allows you to Create, Edit, or Delete Products, refresh the table and cannot add duplicate products. The products are saved in a JSON file.

Project Summary
This project is a demonstration of my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and MVC skills. I created a simple MVC framework with a basic validation library from scratch, added basic routing, and a loader for Views Libraries and Models. This structure makes the maintenance of the project easier and more scalable.
