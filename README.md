# PHP Products Page MCV
## Project Summary
This project is a demonstration of my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and MVC skills. I created a simple MVC framework with a basic validation library from scratch, added basic routing, and a loader for Views Libraries and Models. This structure makes the maintenance of the project easier and more scalable.

## Getting Started
No configurations needed, simply download and run the code in your php server

## Prerequisites
PHP 7.4 or higher
